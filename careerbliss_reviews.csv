Sometimes it can be hard to stay positive or shake off a bad interaction from a jerk customer because your mobile appointments are scheduled within 10 minutes of each other. An average of 6 appointments per the hour is what is expected from you and it can be very trying at times.
You aren't guaranteed your lunch or breaks on time when you have multiple unexpected walk in appointments and you have your own scheduled mobile cue as well. It's hard finding a balance in taking care of customers and also balancing a break to reset yourself and attitude... or to simply take a 5 minute breather.

If you value pushing yourself to areas you did not know were possible then you can come out with a positive experience that can be used for any walk of life.  However, if I think about the overall experience, I would confidently say that the culture is extremely toxic.  There is no better way to say it than just say it.  There are way too many people who are in positions of leadership that are insanely under qualified.  I had Operations Managers who had no idea how to talk to people.  Managers who would sit in an office all day on YouTube and make their supervisors run the shift.  The HR representatives (that are remote/not on site) give you ZERO CONFIDENCE when slippery issues arise.  They also have a track record of paying external talent INSANELY MORE than associates who were promoted from within.  I was making $10-15k less than my fellow managers who were external applicants.  You get less stock units and less salary.  Everybody talks.  The competition revolves around a toxic culture of taking credit for anything and everything as simple as hanging a sign on a door.  You absolutely can't just get the numbers and results with this company, you have to be able to play serious politics with a bunch of people who are terrible at their job and are terrible at communicating with other humans.  The running joke/theme was you have to play the game of CYA (cover your ass).  The micromanaging from Ops is brutal as well.  You are a manager yet are rarely trusted to manage without someone hawking over your shoulder.

You can’t pander to the share holders by treating your workers with common decency and respect.     I personally witnessed the Operations Manager spew the BullSh*t of safety and concern for their employees then turn around and bully employees to meet unattainable goals, and take risks to meet those goals.  One person was being yelled at for being too slow literally 2 hours and 48 minutes into the first day that they were on their own it was their 4th day  working there.   
Its obvious that a management hiring bias is for Indian ethnicity (in Canada) many of which are new immigrants,  as many others have said and I would agree “Great place to work while you look for a job.”   Any perks kick in after 2-5yrs (like stocks and matching RRSP) and so far I haven’t met anyone there…. manager or worker who has been there for 2 years...its that bad.""",high

1769095,Amazon,Stower,283,118390,"""I was recently wrongfully terminated on Friday, January 12, 2018 at the Windsor, Connecticut Amazon Fulfillment Center due to poor productivity which was not my fault. Management would often acknowledge bad freight and I was often given larger products, which was very hard to stow in very pack pods that would often be packed to the max, and the water spiders who gave out the workload would often play favoritism by dividing up the workload unequally and giving their friends or those they are close to all the best mixture of products that made stowing all the more easier to stow. 

There were times I seen water spiders who stowed pick and choose which products to stow from management and management would oblige their requests.

When I was hired back in October - direct hire, I honestly thought this job would be secure with advancement in career but as I worked and received two write-ups for low productivity which was not my fault during peak, due to them having really bad freight PLUS a bad mixture of products to be stowed that took even longer, affecting my rates, and when I asked or told management about this - management would often reassure me that this would not affect my job status or productivity for the week, and in the end I would end up getting written up due to bad productivity. 

Management was quick to write me up for poor productivity and blame me for low rates or low productivity when in truth it was not even my fault - they would often say one thing reassuring me that my job would not be jeopardize and next day I get written up for the very thing I was worried about - low rates and low productivity for something that was clearly out of my control and related to them, not me (i.e. bad freight, bad mixture of products which was the water spiders fault, etc.) - things that were not even in my own control nor my own fault.""",high
1768196,Amazon,Amazon Employee,283,1,"""I work specifically for the Prime Now program at Amazon, as a fulfillment associate. It's miserable. They lure you in with promises of an open work-schedule with plenty of shifts, to let you work around any other jobs. In practice, all the shifts go to those with the fastest computers, and this is exacerbated by an internal program in which those who already get lots of shifts get early access and free pick of the shifts before anyone else, ensuring that they'll remain on top of the pile forever. 
If you get unlucky and can't get any shifts that mesh with your schedule for a while, be prepared to start getting warning emails that are frankly kind of ominous and threatening, saying that if you don't respond and somehow reorganize your schedule and take shifts to meet their quota within a very few days, you'll be automatically fired. I got temporarily terminated despite working enough hours to fill the quota, thanks to the automation, had to fight tooth and claw to get back in, and then because it took me so much time to get reinstated...  they almost immediately started emailing me again threatening to terminate me. 

The warehouses are kind of a catastrophe - poorly organized, outdated jokey ""morale builder"" posters on the walls, and a strong smell of mold in some places. They're difficult to navigate even WITH the scanner you use to pick or stow, and when standards-of-practice change, they won't work with you to train you on the new methodology, so you just have to turn to your fellow employees for help and bumble through. 
HR is slow to respond when you need help with something, and are the ones responsible for the threatening and unhelpful warning emails anyway, so it's kind of self-defeating, trying to reach out to them. 
And last but not least, the CEO is an egotist, buying half the town and turning it into his playground for weird quirky architectural media-coverage magnets. I know they treat the higher-ups better, but if you're offered a fulfillment job... run.""",high

Working on many different projects enabled me to experience numerous aspects of component test to creating successful test structures as well as keeping up to date with the database and software trends. I am extremely grateful for instilling a sense of confidence and responsibility in me.

Thanks you Wes, Akul and Janelle for getting me on-board.

Thank you Andrew for teaching me the importance of teamwork in the success of a project. You and the rest of the team were welcoming, helpful, and offered me ongoing support throughout my internship. Thanks for guiding me through LabVIEW components to generate a vi to send any test data to DB. It was out-of-the-box task for me as I had never ever crossed paths with python or LabVIEW ( except C++ .. but just as a coursework.. never gone to depth…)

Thanks Nic B and Nic M for assisting me with the test files for DB test runs… It was great learning from Nick B about the CATIA Power-Copy… or else I might be still generating the 80-20 tubes J ….

Thank You Elise for being such a good co-intern…

• Company does NOT follow its own standard disciplinary procedures outlined in Corporate Human Resources policies.  Counseling services, performance improvement plans and probation are swiftly bypassed when it is convenient for management.

• Company does NOT follow its own standard employee problem solving procedures outlined in Corporate Human Resources policies.

• Company denied me a severance package upon terminating my job

• Company refused to bridge my pension upon terminating my job just weeks prior to vesting.

• Company assigned its own employee as the independent, third-party reviewer for my job termination appeal.  This employee's relationship with my direct manager led him to immediately dismiss my appeal.
